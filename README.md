# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Analysis-in-Python
The aim of this project is to use the various classification algorithms to predict an IBM employee will leave the company
 or not, i.e. to predict Attrition based on different attributes given in the data. The data provides relevant 
information about each employee of the company as well as the attribute for attrition to train the data. We preprocessed 
the data followed by basic analysis and visualization of all the columns to select the attributes which seemed relevant for
solving the problem statement. We then implemented various supervised classification algorithms on this data followed by 
hyperparameter tuning of the models to predict attrition.
